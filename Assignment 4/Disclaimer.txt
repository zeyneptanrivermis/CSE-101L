Exercises:

Write a code that calculates the area and circumference of a circle. Instead of taking just the radius as input, ask the user for the center coordinates integer (x, y) and a point on the circle’s edge (x, y). Use these coordinates to calculate the area and circumference. 
Write a code that takes a user’s full name as input (assuming they enter their first name followed by their last name with a space in between, so as a single string), and then displays their name in reverse order, with the last name followed by a comma and a space, and then the first name. For example, “John Doe” should be displayed as “Doe, John”. 
Write a code that takes a day number (1-7) as input and prints the corresponding day name without using if-else (Monday-Sunday). 
Write a code that takes three city names from user and displays them ascending order in separate lines.
