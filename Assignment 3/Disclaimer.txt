Exercises:
1- A restaurant has these meals and drinks: 
Id    Meal       Price
1    Doner       80 lira
2    Kebab      110 lira
3    Lahmacun    75 lira

Id  Drink       Price
1     Ayran      10 lira
2     Kola       20 lira
3   Salgam  15 lira

Write a program that:
Reads the id of meal and id of drink (separately) the customer wants. Example inputs: "2", "1"
Prints the total cost. Example output: "Kebab and Ayran 120 lira"
2- An internet provider has 2 types of membership. Type 1 has 100 GB quota for 80 lira and 3 lira per GB use  with 15% tax. Type 2 has 200 GB qouta for 140 lira and 5 lira per GB with 10% tax. Write a program that takes input the member type (Example input: "1") and internet usage as GB (Example input: "250") and prints the total amount the customer has to pay.

3- You designed a Folkémon card. Its attacks depend on coin tosses but you are not sure that the card is balanced or not. So you decided to test this card by using Java. Attacks of this card are:
Attack 1: Flip 2 coins, if both are heads this attack does 60 damage, otherwise this attack does nothing.
Attack 2: Flip 2 coins. This attack does 50 damage plus 20 more damage for each heads.
Write a program that tests these two attacks. The program
Reads the number of attack. Example input: "2"
Reads id for each coin toss. "0" for false/tails, "1" for true/heads, "2" for deciding with Math.random(). Example inputs: "1", "1"
Prints the damage dealt by the attack.
